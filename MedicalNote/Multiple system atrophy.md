# Multiple system atrophy (MSA)

## Subtype
In a 2007 consensus paper 6 MSA has been divided clinically into two forms according to the dominant non-autonomic symptoms: 

1. MSA-C: predominance of cerebellar symptoms (olivopontocerebellar atrophy)
2. MSA-P: predominance of parkinsonian signs and symptoms (striatonigral degeneration)

## Radiologic features
### MRI
- T2 : hyperintensities typically present in the pontocerebellar tracts
  - pons: [[[[hot cross bun sign]]]] (MSA-C)
  - middle cerebellar peduncles
  - cerebellum
- putaminal findings in MSA-P :
  - reduced volume
  - reduced GRE and T2 signal relative to globus pallidus
  - reduced GRE and T2 signal relative to the red nucleus
  - abnormally high T2 linear rim surrounding the putamen (putaminal rim sign), seen at 1.5 T (this is normal at 3 T)  (see case 3)
- MSA-C
  - disproportionate atrophy of the cerebellum and brainstem (especially olivary nuclei and middle cerebellar peduncle)

### Nuclear Medicine
On SPECT/CT with I-123 ioflupane, there is loss of the normal comma- or crescent-shaped tracer uptake in the striatum. Instead, a period- or oval-shaped uptake is seen within the caudate nucleus head without tracer uptake in the putamen. Quantitative assessment reveals reduced uptake in the putamen compared to norms.
