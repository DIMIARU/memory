# Corticobasal degeneration
- Uncommon neurodegenerative disease
- One of the subset of taupathies
  
## Clinical presentation
    - apraxia
    - dystonia
    - postural instability
    - akinetic-rigid syndrome
    - myoclonic jerks
    - cognitive impairment, often with pronounced frontal lobe signs
    - alien limb phenomenon (believed to be due to supplementary motor area involvement)

## Pathology
The characteristic histopathological findings are neuronal loss and numerous "ballooned" achromatic neurons. Although these features are seen throughout the brain, certain regions are more severely affected. They include:

    - frontoparietal cortex
    - subcortical structures
      - striatum
      - substantia niagra
