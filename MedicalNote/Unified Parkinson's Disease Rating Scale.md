# Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
## Objective 
***
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a rating tool used to gauge the the severity and progression of Parkinson’s disease in patients[1].  The UPDRS scale consists of the following six segments: 1) Mentation, Behavior, and Mood, 2) ADL, 3) Motor sections, 4)  Complications of Therapy (in the past week) 5) Modified [[Hoehn and Yahr Scale]] , and 6) Schwab and England ADL scale. The first four segments are made up of 42 items grouped into four subscales. The UPDRS was developed in 1987 as a gold standard by neurologists for monitoring the response to medications used to decrease the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's.

## Intended Population 
***
People with Parkinson disease.

## Method of Use 
***
### Equipment Required:
Pen and Paper

### Duration:
20 mins[2]

### Scoring:
Parts 1 to 3 are scored on a 0-4 rating scale. Part 4 is scored with yes and no ratings. Higher scores show increased severity. Then the administrator rates the patient on  the H and Y Scale and the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale.

Permission of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society  is required before using the scale.

## Evidence
***
### Reliability   
The UPDRS has shown excellent internal consistency across multiple studies and  across stages of disease severity as measured by the Hoehn and Yahr staging system[2][3].
Inter-rater reliability was  found to  be adequate for the total UPDRS as well as the Activities of Daily Living and the Motor Examination sections[4][5].
The Intra-class correlation coefficients were very high: total score:  0.92; Mentation: 0.74; Activities of Daily Living: 0.85; Motor: 0.90[6][7].

### Validity 
Adequate Face Validity[8]
Studies have demonstrated that the UPDRS is sensitive to change in clinical status[9].

### Miscellaneous 
The UPDRS has been modified since its conception into:

- Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS): The revision was made after an MDS-sponsored Task Force on Rating Scales for Parkinson's Disease highlighted the limitations of the original UPDRS. The scale was modifies into 4 parts: Part I, Nonmotor aspects of experiences of daily living (6 items assessed by interview and 7 items by self-assessment); Part II, Motor aspects of experiences of daily living (13 self-assessed items); Part III, Motor examination (18 items resulting in 33 scores by location and lateralization); and part IV, Motor complications (3 items for dyskinesia and 3 for fluctuation)[9]. 
- UPDRS-8[10]: 8 items from the original UPDRS comprise the UPDRS-8. All are rated on a 5-point (0–4) scale. The items selected are:
  1. Nonmotor: Cognition (UPDRS item 1), Mood (UPDRS item 3)
  2. Motor: Rest tremor upper extremity—right, left (UPDRS item 20), Finger taps—right, left (UPDRS item 23), Gait (UPDRS item 29)
  3. Motor complications: Off time (UPDRS item 39), Dyskinesia duration (UPDRS item 32),  Dyskinesia disability (UPDRS item 33)
